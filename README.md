C-CUBE Standard Library is a Standard Library created for the C-CUBE programming language developed by Sahne Dünya. C-CUBE is a programming language developed by Sahne Dünya based on C/C++ and designed for game development. The purpose of developing the programming language called C-CUBE is to take the first place in game development and to be the language most supported by game engines and also to make game development incredibly easy. This programming language appeals to software developers in the game world. The Standard Library of this programming language is focused on game development, in fact it is so rich that I can automatically say that there are Graphics and GPU APIs! In addition, the fact that the C-CUBE programming language is based on C/C++ means that it is high-performance and being an interpretable language provides ease of development! Developing games using this programming language is easier compared to other languages ​​and developing game engines for this programming language is simpler than others. Even better news is that this programming language is open source.
